# Architecture Standards

- **Language:** Strictly **Rust** for all backend and logic implementations.
- **Environment:** **Bare Metal** implementation only. No Docker/Containers.
- **Networking:**
  - Backend/API ports: `8000 - 8099` (Gateway on **8000**)
  - Frontend/UI ports: `3001 - 3099`
- **Memory System:** Multi-layer (Short-term & Long-term).
- **Knowledge Bases:** Maintain 7 to 8 distinct Knowledge Bases.
- **Skills:** Implementation must follow a modular "Skills-type" solution for the Orchestrator.

# Verification Law

- **No blind approvals:** An implementation is NOT successful until the Agent has opened the Cursor Browser and confirmed the UI is rendered and the API handshake is complete.
- **Port ranges:** Strictly enforce 8000–8099 (Backend, Gateway on 8000) and 3001–3099 (Frontend).
- **Bare metal:** Never suggest Docker as a solution for port conflicts; use `Stop-Process` (Windows) or `fuser` (Unix) instead.
